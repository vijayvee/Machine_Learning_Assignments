## Solutions for assignments from Machine Learning, Stanford University (from Coursera)
This repository contains the code for all the programming assignments I completed for a course on Machine Learning, from Coursera. The course was instructed by Dr. Andrew.N.G, from Stanford University. I've coded all the assignments in Octave.
